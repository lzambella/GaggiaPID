#### Espresso PID controller firmware

A very basic PID controller for a Gaggia Classic Pro. Contains a single
LED display for target temperature and a dial to set the temperature along
with a bunch of safety checks that ensures the boiler wobn't overheat.

Device is still in development and in time will have a handful of more features
such as on-device LED indicators and showing current temperature by default
with target temperature on shown on change.

Currently, PID tuning is completely manual and I found that only a P controller
is serviceable for the time being (despite having a lot of overshoot).
